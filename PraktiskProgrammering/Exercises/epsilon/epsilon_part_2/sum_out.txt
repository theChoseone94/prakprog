Sum_up is given as: 15.403683
Sum_down is given as: 18.807919
The difference must be in the precision of the float data type.
So it is not as precise as one might think
 and the number of digits is not as high
Does the sum converge as a function of max?
I tried change max to INT_MAX/3 and INT_MAX/4 and nothing changed
Sum_up_double is given as: 21.3716
Sum_down_double is given as: 21.3716
They are now the same number, which they should be.
So it must the number of decimal places/precision
