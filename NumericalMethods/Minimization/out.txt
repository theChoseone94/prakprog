Minimization with Newton's method


The Rosenbrock
Finished after 609 iterations.
The minimum of the Rosenbrock function is [1. 1.]


The Himmelblau
Finished after 9 iterations.
The minimum of the Himmelblau function is [3. 2.]


Minimization with the QuasiNewton method
Finished after 52 iterations.
The minimum of the Rosenbrock function is [0.9999997 0.9999994]


Finished after 12 iterations.
The minimum of the Himmelblau function is [ 3.58442834 -1.84812653]


When comparing the # of iterations, it is clear that the
that the Quasi-Newton method is much faster.
For the Rosenbrock is 609 vs. 52 iterations
and for the Himmelblau it is 9 vs 12.
It should be noted that the Himmelblau finds another minimum.


Decay function
Finished after 221 iterations.
The fit from the decay can be seen in decay.pdf
